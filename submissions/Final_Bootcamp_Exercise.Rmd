## Import data
Import NY school and county data
```{r data_imports}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

schools <- read.csv("nys_schools.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
acs <- read.csv("nys_acs.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

schools[schools == -99] <- NA
schools[schools == " "] <- NA
schools %>%
  na.omit()
summary(schools)

View(schools)

new_school <- merge(schools, acs, by = c("county_name","year"))

new_school %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean1 = mean(mean_ela_score)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean1, col = 'green'), size = 1.5) +

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
